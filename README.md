# Hi there, I'm Gazh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Backend Developer specializing in creating robust, scalable, and real-time applications with **NestJS** and **TypeScript**.

I'm passionate about clean architecture, data-driven design, and building the powerful server-side logic that brings complex applications to life. I thrive on solving intricate problems, from real-time communication to competitive ranking systems.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Currently Building

I'm the lead backend developer for **Theramor**, a turn-based tactical RPG featuring a complex, data-driven architecture. This project showcases my ability to implement professional-grade features, including:

-   An **event-driven combat engine** designed for complex, reactive spell and effect interactions.
-   A sophisticated, per-bracket **competitive ladder system** using the **Glicko-2** algorithm with a dual (hidden MMR / visible Rating) structure.
-   Real-time **matchmaking**, in-game chat, and state synchronization via **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**.
-   A full in-game economy with a currency system (`Gold`) and an item shop with MMR-locked items.
-   A robust, self-documented REST API using **OpenAPI (Swagger)** for all non-gameplay features.
